About whatstk
=============

**whatstk**  is a python package providing tools to parse, analyze and visualize WhatsApp chats developed under the
`sociepy <https://github.com/sociepy>`_ project. Easily convert your chats to csv or simply visualize statistics
using the python library. The package uses `pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_ to
process the data and `plotly <https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py>`_ to visualise it.

You can also [try a live demo](https://whatstk.streamlit.app/).


The project is distributed under the `GPL-3.0 license <https://github.com/lucasrodes/whatstk/blob/master/LICENSE>`_
and is available on `GitHub <http://github.com/lucasrodes/whatstk>`_.

First contact with whatstk
--------------------------
**whatstk** is built around :func:`BaseChat <whatstk._chat.BaseChat>` object interface, which requires class method
:func:`from_source <whatstk._chat.BaseChat.from_source>` to be implemented. This method loads and parses the source 
chat file into a pandas.DataFrame.

Below, we use method :func:`df_from_txt_whatsapp <whatstk.whatsapp.parser.df_from_txt_whatsapp>` to load `LOREM chat
<http://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucasrodes/whatstk/develop/chats/whatsapp/lorem.txt>`_. To test it with your own 
chat, simply :ref:`export it as a txt file<Export chat>` to your computer and then use class argument ``filepath``, as
shown in the following example.


.. code-block:: python

    >>> from whatstk import df_from_txt_whatsapp
    >>> from whatstk.data import whatsapp_urls
    >>> df = df_from_txt_whatsapp(filepath=whatsapp_urls.LOREM)
    >>> df.head(5)
                     date        username                                            message
